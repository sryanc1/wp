                I often come up with "interesting" ideas and definitely see myself as a person "that thinks outside the box".

                <td>From this course, Iâ€™m hoping to gain the skills required to develop basic websites with some interactivity and backend functionality. 
                I like the idea of websites that actually <strong> do </strong>  something as opposed to just displaying information. 
				In my current workplace we are still using paper based timesheets. 
				I would love to develop a simple site that could read a spreadsheet roster as input and output a completed timesheet.
				I have developed one using a Google Form where users select each shift as input. 
				A script in the background would then populate fields in a Google Doc and email the complateted timesheet back to the user. 
				No <strong> manuel </strong> input would be even better!</td>

                Lately I've also been trudging my way through Googles Tensorflow tutorials.</td>

					<ul>
						<li>I enjoy playing around with all kinds of tech, breaking it and putting it back together. 
						Lately I've been playing around with Tensorflow, working out how to make / refine an immage clasifyer. 
						I need to make sure this dosen't cut into my study time to much!</li>
						<li>I enjoy hicking, there are some decent trails around Adelaide - particularly parts of the Hysen Trail</li>
						<li>Drawing, mainly scenic sketches</li>
						<li>My wife and I are also currently renovating an old church hall as a home. We have both enjoyed the design process and seeing the fruits of our labour as it all come together.
						I think I prefer this type of constuction though, its <strong> much </strong> easier to fix mistakes.
